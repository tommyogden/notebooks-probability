    "Intuitively, $P(a)$ quantifies our confidence that the event $a$ will occur. But this doesn't tell us what the quantity means. Two common interpretations: _frequentist_ and _bayesian_ (a.k.a. _subjectivist_).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequentist**: probabilities are frequencies of events -- the fraction of times the event occurs if we repeat the measurement indefinitely. Limit of sequence of fractions of events in $a$ in $n$ measurements as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: the event 'It will rain tomorrow afternoon'. Not clear how to define the frequency of an event that's only going to happen once. So no satisfactory interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian**: $P(a) = 0.3$ represents subjective statement about my degree of belief that the event $a$ will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: need to explain how subjective beliefs are reflected in action. One way is to see how much you're willing to bet. If degrees of belief don't match the rules of a probability distribution, we can find a series of bets that results in a sure negative outcome.  The argument is then that a rational agent must hold degrees of belief that satisfy rules of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same technical interpretation for both."
